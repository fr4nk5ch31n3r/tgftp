tgftp distribution v0.4.1b:
Introduced own version number for tgftp distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by tgftp itself, as updates to other parts of
the distribution would not justify a new version number for tgftp.

tgftp.1:
Adapted manual page to new functionalities introduced in tgftp v0.4.1.

modulefile:
Reintegrated a modulfile for tgftp.

Also readded PDF versions of manual pages. Adapted INSTALL file.

tgftp dist v0.4.2:

tgftp v0.4.2:
Versioning of tgftp now tries to conform to the "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0-rc.1"
specification (see [1] for details).

Adapted tgftp in that way that instances of tgftp running in parallel (and in
the same current working directory) don't interfere with each other.

tgftp now also behaves "correctly" on SIGINT. See [2] for an elaborate
discussion about this. Also integrated a workaround into tgftp to handle a guc
flaw, where guc returns 0 when interrupted with SIGINT. This lead tgftp to
assume guc finished a transfer when guc was interrupted with a SIGINT in real.

The reason is the following:
Currently guc (vX.x <= v8.2) does exit on SIGINT unconventionally, meaning it
catches a SIGINT, but after doing its internal cleanup and writing out a
possible dumpfile, it does not reset the SIGINT handler to the default SIGINT
handler andkills itself with SIGINT, but simply exits normally (leading to "0"
as exit value in the bash shell). "Correct" would be an exit value of "130"
(which is 128 + <SIGNAL>, with <SIGNAL> being SIGINT, which is "2"). See [2] for
more details.

The workaround parses the guc log for the string "Cancelling copy...", as guc
emits this string when interrupted.

As you can imagine, this is not very safe, because if the string changes with
later versions of guc, tgftp will be hit by this flaw again. But as guc won't be
patched any time soon, I consider this ok, as it allows a user of gtransfer [3]
to savely interrupt a data transfer.

tgftp dist v0.4.3:

tgftp v0.4.3:
The SIGINT handler was not reset to the default handler due to a missing "-"
between "trap" and "SIGINT" (hence v0.4.2 didn't behave "correctly" on SIGINT).
This is now fixed.
