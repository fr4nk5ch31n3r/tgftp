tgftp distribution v0.4.1b:
Introduced own version number for tgftp distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by tgftp itself, as updates to other parts of
the distribution would not justify a new version number for tgftp.

Adapted manual page to new functionalities introduced in tgftp v0.4.1.

modulefile:
Reintegrated a modulfile for tgftp.

Also readded PDF versions of manual pages. Adapted INSTALL file.
