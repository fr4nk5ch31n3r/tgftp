*0.4.1 (tgftp):
Introduced new option "--force-log-overwrite" to force tgftp to overwrite
existing logfiles. Updated help and man page.

*0.4.1a (tgftp):
Corrected two errors (local keyword used outside of a function and typo
on variable name).

Corrected ChangeLog date of previous entry.

tgftp distribution v0.4.1b:
Introduced own version number for tgftp distribution. The version number of
the dist. is no longer determined by tgftp itself, as updates to other parts of
the distribution would not justify a new version number for tgftp.

tgftp.1:
Adapted manual page to new functionalities introduced in tgftp v0.4.1.

modulefile:
Reintegrated a modulfile for tgftp.

Also readded PDF versions of manual pages. Adapted INSTALL file.

tgftp dist v0.4.2:

tgftp v0.4.2:
Versioning of tgftp now tries to conform to the "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0-rc.1"
specification (see [1] for details).

Adapted tgftp in that way that instances of tgftp running in parallel (and in
the same current working directory) don't interfere with each other.

tgftp now also behaves "correctly" on SIGINT. See [2] for an elaborate
discussion about this. Also integrated a workaround into tgftp to handle a guc
flaw, where guc returns 0 when interrupted with SIGINT. This lead tgftp to
assume guc finished a transfer when guc was interrupted with a SIGINT in real.

The reason is the following:
Currently guc (vX.x <= v8.2) does exit on SIGINT unconventionally, meaning it
catches a SIGINT, but after doing its internal cleanup and writing out a
possible dumpfile, it does not reset the SIGINT handler to the default SIGINT
handler andkills itself with SIGINT, but simply exits normally (leading to "0"
as exit value in the bash shell). "Correct" would be an exit value of "130"
(which is 128 + <SIGNAL>, with <SIGNAL> being SIGINT, which is "2"). See [2] for
more details.

The workaround parses the guc log for the string "Cancelling copy...", as guc
emits this string when interrupted.

As you can imagine, this is not very safe, because if the string changes with
later versions of guc, tgftp will be hit by this flaw again. But as guc won't be
patched any time soon, I consider this ok, as it allows a user of gtransfer [3]
to savely interrupt a data transfer.

tgftp dist v0.4.3:

tgftp v0.4.3:
The SIGINT handler was not reset to the default handler due to a missing "-"
between "trap" and "SIGINT" (hence v0.4.2 didn't behave "correctly" on SIGINT).
This is now fixed.

tgftp dist v0.4.4:

tgftp v0.4.4:
Corrected small error in the shabang of the auto-tuning batchjob header. Also
added a clause that checks if the needed FIFO could be created. If not tgftp
will exit immediately.

2012-10-12  Frank Scheiner  <frank.scheiner@web.de>

tgftp dist v0.4.5:

tgftp v0.4.5:
The check for successful FIFO creation added in v0.4.4 contained an error, as
the commands after the "||" keyword have to be enclosed in "(...)" (subshell) in
order to work in the correct way. In v0.4.4 this lead to an unconditional exit.
This is now fixed.

tgftp dist v0.5.0:

tgftp v0.5.0:
The subshell introduced in v0.4.5 needed to be replaced, because the internal
exit command just exited the subshell but should exit the main program if
triggered. This is now fixed.

Also added specific exit codes to tgftp for interoperability with other tools.

If transfer length was given in Bytes (no unit at the end of the number), the
used length was used wrongly (=> devided by ten as the last digit was removed).
This is now fixed.

In addition to that, tgftp can now calculate the transfer rate also when the
transfer size is not given (by using some internal functions of gtransfer). It
uses guc to get a dump of the files to be transferred and sums up all file sizes
to get the transfer size.

Reworked man page for tgftp.

Also fixed some internal inconsistencies:
* Error and warning messages no go to STDERR.
* When tgftp and/or guc is intrrupted, tgftp won't calculate a (then wrong)
  transfer rate
  
Reorganized directory structure of "source" files.
