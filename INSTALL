(1) Dependencies:
------------------

To run the scripts in this distribution (namely "tgftp" and "tgftp_log"), some
dependencies have to be met first. These scripts need the following binaries in
$PATH for operation:

* uname
* cat
* cut (GNU coreutils)
* sleep (GNU coreutils)
* grep/egrep (GNU versions)
* sed (GNU version)
* globus-url-copy

NOTICE:

On Linux systems ("uname" returns "Linux") "tgftp" uses the default $PATH to
search for the required tools. On AIX systems ("uname" returns "AIX") the script
uses "/opt/freeware/bin/" to search for the required tools. Other operating
systems are currently not supported, but the script can be easily patched, if
the required tools are available. Please follow the message that is printed out
if you run this script on an operating system different from Linux or AIX.

(2) Installation:
------------------

For installation just run "./install.sh" (user install). This will create a
directory named "bin" and a directory structure below "opt/tgftp/" in your home
(if not already existing). The scripts of the tgftp distro are copied to
"$HOME/opt/tgftp/bin/" and links will be created in "$HOME/bin/", so one can run
them directly.

If you add a path to "./install.sh" (system install), the tgftp distribution
will be installed in "path/tgftp/" instead.  For a system install, the links
to the scripts will be created in "path/tgftp/bin/".

(2.1) Modulefile:
------------------

To ease usage of this tool for DEISA users a DEISA Modules Enviroment (DME)
compatible modulefile has been created. All related files are stored below
"./modulefiles". For installation copy the "./modulefiles/tools/tgftp/" dir to
your DME tools dir. The local configuration file in
"./modulefiles/sitelocal/tools/" goes to your DME "[...]/sitelocal/tools" dir.
After installing the modulefile please adapt the local configuration file to
your needs.

(3) Uninstallation:
--------------------

For uninstallation just run the link "./uninstall.sh". This will remove the
"testgftp.sh" script and its link from "$HOME/bin". If you add a path to
"./install.sh", the tgftp script will be removed from in "path/tgftp/bin/"
instead.
